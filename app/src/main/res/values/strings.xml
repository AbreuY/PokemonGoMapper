        Version 1.1 - 7/23/16\n\n\n
        Search algorithm is more efficient.\n\n
        Search speed is much faster.\n\n
        You can now switch between searching your location and searching where the map is looking.
            To switch, press the button at the top left corner of the map.\n\n
        The map will stop showing Pokemon if you are zoomed too far out, to prevent the device from slowing down.\n\n
